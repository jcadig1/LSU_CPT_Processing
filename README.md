# CPT_Processing
Data processing script to process raw CPT data files. Script is specifically formatted for the output files produced by Vertek (http://www.vertekcpt.com/) cone penetrometers, however could be modified to only run following the section where voltages are converted into engineering units for other data file formats.

# To Run:
Copy all raw data files into both the Cone/ and Ball/ directories. Open the script in Matlab, make any necessary modifications such as the name of the output workbook, run the file.
